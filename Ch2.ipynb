Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using $\\epsilon$-greedy, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of $A_1(a)=0, \\forall a$. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is $A_1=1, R_1=-1,A_2=2,R_2=1,A_3=2,R_3=-2,A_4=2,R_4=2,A_5=3,R_5=0$. \n",

The $\\epsilon$ case could also have occurred on time steps $1$ and $2$, however in these cases there were multiple actions with the maximum action-value estimate, and so the agent would have chosen one of these randomly even if the $\\epsilon$ case did not occur.\n",

The $\\epsilon=0.1$ method selects the optimal action with probability $0.9$ of the time, giving an average reward-per-step of $0.9 \\times 1.55 = 1.395$. The $\\epsilon=0.01$ selects the optimal action with a probability of $0.99$, giving an average reward-per-step of $0.99 \\times 1.55 = 1.5345$.\n",

    "In terms of cumulative reward after convergence, the $\\epsilon=0.01$ method will perform best. However in the example shown, up to the maximum 1000 steps, the $\\epsilon=0.1$ method performs best, and it is clear from visual inspection that this method has the greatest area under the curve (cumulative reward).\n",

Use a modified version of the 10-armed bandit testbed in which all the $q_*(a)$ start out equal and the take independent random walks (say by adding a normally distributed increment with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.01 to all the $q_*(a)$ on each step). Prepare plots like Figure 2.2 for an action-value method using sample averages, incrementally computed, and another action-value method using a constant step-size parameter, $\\alpha=0.1$. Use $\\epsilon=0.1$ and longer runs, say of $10,000$ steps."

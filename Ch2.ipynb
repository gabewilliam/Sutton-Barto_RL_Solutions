    "Q: _'Consider a k-armed bandit problem with $k=4$ actions, denoted 1,2,3, and 4. Consider applying to this problem a bandit algorithm using $\\epsilon$-greedy, sample-average action-value estimates, and initial estimates of $A_1(a)=0, \\forall a$. Suppose the initial sequence of actions and rewards is $A_1=1, R_1=-1,A_2=2,R_2=1,A_3=2,R_3=-2,A_4=2,R_4=2,A_5=3,R_5=0$. On some of these time steps the $\\epsilon$ case may have occurred, causing an action to be selected at random. On which time steps did this definitely occur? On which time steps could this possibly have occurred?'_\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The action-value estimate $Q_t(a)$ for each action $a$ after each time step $t$ is shown in the following table:\n",

    "At time step $5$, $A_3$ is selected, despite $A_2$ having the highest action-value estimate of $0.333$, and so the $\\epsilon$ case must have occurred here. The $\\epsilon$ case could also have occurred on time steps $1$ and $2$, however in these cases there were multiple actions with the maximum action-value estimate, and so the agent would have chosen one of these randomly if the $\\epsilon$ case did not occur."
